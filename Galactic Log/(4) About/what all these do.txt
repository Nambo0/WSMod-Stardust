Each sub-menu will just display a pure text box with only the
ability to back-out (multiple pages if needed) to explain each
concept:

========================================================================
Unlocking Bonus Modes:
Bonus modes can be unlocked by completing specific [GOLD]achievements\

[GOLD]STUNT PILOT\ | Complete 1 [PURP]stunt goal\ in each world  ~  (Unlocks Interstellar)

More info on [GOLD]achievements\ can be found in that section of the
Galactic log.

========================================================================
Stunt Goals:
Every stage in Story Mode has a purple [PURP]Stunt Goal\ in a
particularly hard to reach spot (sometimes multiple spots). Clearing
one in Story or Practice Mode will award that stage's [PURP]Stunt Badge\[ICON].
Badges on every stage can be found in the [BLUE]Story Mode\ section of the
Galactic log.

========================================================================
Bunch Sweeps:
Various types of [YELLOW]banana bunches\ can be found in Story Mode.

[YELLOW]Normal Bunches\ award 10 bananas
[GREEN]Green Super Bunches\ award 20 bananas
[BLUE]Blue Super Bunches\ award 30 bananas
[PURPLE]Purple Super Bunches\ award 50 bananas

Collecting every single bunch on a stage will award that stage's
[YELOW]Sweep Badge\[ICON]. Badges on every stage can be found in the
[BLUE]Story Mode\ section of the Galactic log.

========================================================================
Interstellar: [BEFORE UNLOCK]
Unlock this bonus mode by claiming the following achievement:

[GOLD]STUNT PILOT\ | Complete 1 [PURP]stunt goal\ in each world  ~  (Unlocks Interstellar)

You can check which [PURP]stunt goals\ you've completed by looking for
[PURP]Stunt Badges\[ICON] in the [BLUE]Story Mode\ section of the Galactic log.

Interstellar: [AFTER UNLOCK]
Interstellar is a bonus mode with 10 massive bonus stages played
back-to-back. You have 300 seconds (or 60 in Blitz Mode) to collect as many
[YELLOW]bananas\ as possible on all 10 stages, and at the end your total
banana count will be ranked. High score runs can be viewed in the Interstellar
section of the [BLUE]Galactic log\

[PENALTIES & BONUSES]
Falling out does NOT reset the timer or bunches collected. Instead, you
will incur a 20 second penalty each time you fall out.

Each stage has a [YELLOW]banana goal\ which will award 50 bananas upon
completion. Remember that it will bring you to the next stage, so only
go for the goal once you're satisfied with your banana count!

Collecting every bunch AND finishing in the banana goal on one stage
will award a [YELLOW]Sweep Bonus\, which will give 5 extra bananas for
every second left on the timer.
========================================================================
Debug: [BEFORE UNLOCK]
Unlock this bonus mode by claiming the following achievement:

[GOLD]STUNT SPECIALIST\ | Complete all 10 Stunt Goals in any world  ~  (Unlocks Debug stages)

You can check which [PURP]stunt goals\ you've completed by looking for
[PURP]Stunt Badges\[ICON] in the [BLUE]Story Mode\ section of the Galactic log.

Debug[AFTER UNLOCK]
Debug is a bonus mode made up of unfinished concepts, outdated prototypes,
and silly joke stages. The category is split up into 4 sub-sections:

HOT GARBAGE | Joke/troll stages that I made for fun
VERSION 0's | Old revisions of stages that got heavily changed or completely re-made
UNUSED CONCEPTS | Stage concepts that never got fully realized into fully-fledged stages
THE UNPLAYABLE ZONE | Concepts or joke stages that are either STUPIDLY hard, or straight up impossible
    * In all modes, stages can be skipped by holding DPAD DOWN for 3 seconds.

PLEASE NOTE: This mode is meant to be a silly showcase of the inner
workings of this pack's development. I'm fully aware that these stages
are bad. [GREEN]That's why they are here.\ I hope you enjoy how broken
they are \o/
