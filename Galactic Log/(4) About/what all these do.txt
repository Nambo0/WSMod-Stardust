Each sub-menu will just display a pure text box with only the
ability to back-out (multiple pages if needed) to explain each
concept:

Unlocking bonus modes: Explain that unlocks are tied to specific
achievements listed in that part of the Galactic log. maybe say
what each one is so the player knows what to look for

Stunt goals: Explain that there's a purple goal on every stage,
and that all stunt goal completions are tracked as "Stunt Badges"
for each stage in the "Story Mode" section of the Galactic Log

Bunch Sweeps: Explain that getting every bunch on a stage and
finishing will award a "Bunch sweep badge", which is also tracked
in the "Story Mode" section of the galactic log

Interstellar: BEFORE ITS UNLOCKED explain that its unlocked by
the achievement for getting 1 stunt badge in each world, and progress
can be seen in the "Story Mode" section of the galactic log
AFTER ITS UNLOCKED explain that its a 10-stage bonus mode where u
play 10 bonus stages in a row, and the goal is to get as many bananas
as possible.
On another page, explain that getting a "banana goal" will award 50
bananas, but is a tradeoff cuz it ends ur attempt at that bonus stage
early (The bonus stages will be VERY hard to perfect clear)
On another page, explain that getting all bananas on an interstellar
stage and finishing in the banana goal will award a "Sweep Bonus",
which will award some bonus bananas based on the time left on the
timer (I may do 1s = 5 extra bananas)

Debug: BEFORE ITS UNLOCKED explain that its unlocked by the
achievement for clearing story mode
AFTER ITS UNLOCKED explain that its a fun collection of WIP-stages
and random hot garbage I made during development, that I figured
I'd make playable thru a challenge category
