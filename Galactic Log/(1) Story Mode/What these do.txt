About badges will explain that this section of the menu tracks
badges for story mode stages including bonus content like
stunt goals and bunch sweeps, which are explained further
in the "About" section of the galactic log
Include a Brief summary of the 3 types of badges with their symbols

Each world page will bring up 10 rows, one for each stage in
that world. A row will display
- The stage name (1-1 Impression... etc)
- The Clear Badge (Filled in if they have it)
- The Stunt Badge (Filled in if they have it)
- The Sweep Badge (Filled in if they have it)
- MAYBE best time/score if they're not crazy hard to track

Each of the 3 badges will show up as little circular images which
I plan on hijacking part of a japanese characters texture for
So one row may look roughly like this:

1-1 Impression . . . . . ● ○ ●
1-2 Leany Bridges  . . . ● ● ○
1-3 Showerhead . . . . . ○ ○ ○

Above all these I'll add a little key showing which symbol
corresponds to which badge, as well as "empty" for un-filled-in
badges
