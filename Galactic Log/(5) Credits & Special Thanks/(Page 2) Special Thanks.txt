Thank you ALL of my fellow custom level creators in this server, you know who you are.

(>^-^)> Literally every name listed above (In the interest of not repeating a ton of names, go read them again if you want)
Non-repeat names:
(>^-^)> Zona, Ghost Ham, Sudachi (Level creators who I spent a lot of time hanging out with and didnt get a specific mention above)
(>^-^)> PetresInc (Let me blab about my progress in all of his streams, and constantly showed excitement for the pack)
(>^-^)> Dwaitley (One of the most kind and supportive people Ive ever met. Dwait Epic.)
(>^-^)> Scrap (We frequently discussed the development of our packs together in DMs)
(>^-^)> Petra, Yhouse, Jesse, Ariana, and Shadow (My TTRPG friend group who I showed progress to nearly every week)
There's a ton more I want to mention but I need to cut myself off somewhere or this will be 10,000 characters long, so here's some broad shout-outs:
(>^-^)> Friends from Monkey Ball speedrunning
(>^-^)> Friends from Random Randos
(>^-^)> My family (For hopefully obvious reasons)
Your excitement and kind words legitimately mean the world to me.
And finally...
(>^-^)> YOU. Yeah, it's cheesy, but it's true. If you came to enjoy my stages, you're the reason I made this pack.
Thank you for playing the thing I made, and I hope you have fun! \o/
