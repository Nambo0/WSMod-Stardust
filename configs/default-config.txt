// stage hits zero, the stage is completed with a 'Perfect' pop-up and voice
// line, identical to SMB1.

// fix-stage-object-reflection
//
// Fixes an issue where goal posts would not reflect properly, and makes any 
// stage object with the effect bitflag 0x4 reflect in a reflective stage object.

// enhance-reflective-surfaces
//
// Allows for arbitrarily many mirror planes on a stage, rendering the mirror plane
// from the origin of the reflective object nearest to the player. Also applies the
// item group/collision header transformation to the mirror plane, allowing for
// reflective objects to be animated.

// custom-music-id
//
// Draws music ID data from a per-stage list, defined below, instead of basing
// it on the active theme.

// custom-theme-id
//
// Draws theme ID data from a per-stage list, defined below, instead of using
// the built-in list.

// skip-intro-movie
//
// Skips the AV logo and intro movie sequence on game start, immediately
// skipping to the title screen.

// and unlocks all party games. 

// fix-storm-continue-platform
//
// Fixes an issue with the storm theme where rain droplet splashes would not appear
// correctly on the continue platform.

// fix-any-percent-crash
//
// Fixes an issue where skipping more than two or three stages in story mode with the
// any% skip glitch would lead to the game crashing. Please note that this allows for
// up to 99 skips to be performed. 

// party-game-toggle
//
// Permanently enables or disables party games based off the Party Game Toggles
// list, defined below.

// enable-menu-reflections
//
// Allows for the stages that appear in the background of the menu, stages 3 and 201,
// to have mirrors in the background. This is experimental and may cause issues.

// custom-world-count
//
// Allows for the number of worlds in story mode to be modified. After the final world,
// the end cutscene will play, or the credits sequence will start if the cutscene skip
// patch is enabled. The minimum value is 1, and the maximum value is 10.

// stobj-draw-fix
//
// Stage objects (stobjs) like party balls and goaltapes may show up incorrectly
// or not at all if they reside on an itemgroup whose index is >127. This patch
// increases the limit to 256 total itemgroups.
