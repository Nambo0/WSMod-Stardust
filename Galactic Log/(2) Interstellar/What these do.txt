The about sub-menu will take u to the about section that
explains interstellar (see that txt document)

The "Best run" submenu will only be accessible (or show at all)
if the mode is unlocked
I plan to save the banana count of the best interstellar run gotten
and display it here, alongside a breakdown of how many bananas that
run got on each stage, which ones got banana goal bonus and/or
sweep bonus, etc.
