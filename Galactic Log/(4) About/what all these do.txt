Badges:
Each Story Mode stage has 3 objectives tracked in the [BLUE]Story Mode\
section of the Galactic Log, each one represented by a circular badge.

[ICON, BLUE] Clear Badge:\ Complete that stage's normal goal
[ICON, PURPLE] Stunt Badge:\ Complete that stage's stunt goal
[ICON, YELLOW] Sweep Badge:\ Complete that stage with every bunch
collected in one run

Each world has 1 stage that displays an extra badge:
[ICON, ORANGE TEXT] Challenge Badge:\ Complete that stage's special
challenge, which can be found in the [ORANGE]Achievements\ section of
the Galactic Log

Badges can also be viewed by their respective world statues on Monuments

========================================================================

Various types of [YELLOW]banana bunches\ can be found in Story Mode.

[YELLOW]Normal Bunches\ award 10 bananas
[GREEN]Green Cosmic Bunches\ award 20 bananas
[BLUE]Blue Cosmic Bunches\ award 30 bananas
[PURPLE]Purple Cosmic Bunches\ award 50 bananas

Collecting every single bunch on a stage will award that stage's

========================================================================
Unlocking Bonus Modes: [BEFORE UNLOCK]
Unlock this bonus mode by claiming the following achievement:

[GOLD]STUNT PILOT\ | Complete 1 [PURP]stunt goal\ in each world  ~  (Unlocks All Bonus Modes)

More info on [ORANGE]achievements\ can be found in that section of the
Galactic log.

========================================================================
Interstellar: [AFTER UNLOCK]
Interstellar is a bonus mode with 10 massive bonus stages played
back-to-back. You have 300 seconds to collect as many [YELLOW]bananas\
as possible on all 10 stages. High score runs can be viewed in the
Interstellar section of the [BLUE]Galactic log\

[PENALTIES & BONUSES]
Falling out does NOT reset the timer or bunches collected. Instead, you
will incur a 15 second penalty each time you fall out.

Each stage has a goal which will award [YELLOW]50 bananas\ upon
completion. The goal will bring you to the next stage, so try to spend
as much time as possible collecting bunches!

[RANNKS]
There are 5 ranks based on different banana-count milestones:
1000+: BRONZE RANK
2000+: SILVER RANK
3000+: GOLD RANK
4000+: PLATINUM RANK
5000+: STAR RANK
Your best rank is represented by a medallion on the center of Monuments

========================================================================
Debug: [AFTER UNLOCK]
Debug is a bonus mode made up of unfinished concepts, outdated prototypes,
and silly joke stages. The category is split up into 4 sub-sections:

[GREEN] JOKE STAGES | Joke/troll stages that I made for fun
[BLUE] STAGE DRAFTS | Old revisions of stages that got re-made,
                      and stage concepts that never became fully-fledged stages
[PURP] THE UNPLAYABLE ZONE | Concepts or joke stages that are either STUPIDLY hard, or straight up impossible
    * In all modes, stages can be skipped by holding B for 3 seconds.

PLEASE NOTE: This mode is meant to be a silly showcase of the inner
workings of this pack's development. I'm fully aware that these stages
are bad. [GREEN]That's why they are here.\ I hope you enjoy how broken
they are \o/

========================================================================
Monuments: [AFTER UNLOCK]
Monuments is a trophy room for some of this pack's bonus goals!

The surrounding statues each represent one world, and above it you
can see which badges badges you have completed. The world's stage
challenge achievement is marked as an [ORANGE]Challenge badge\ above
those 3 rows.

If you get all 10 stunt or sweep badges in any world, that world's statue
will be decorated with a special effect!

If you get all 100 stunt goals or sweep badges, something special will
appear on the giant empty pedestals outside the circle!

The center of the stage has a spinning medallion representing your best interstellar rank!
