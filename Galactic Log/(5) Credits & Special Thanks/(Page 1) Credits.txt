||   Code   ||
Stardust features some special code written specifically for it, made by:
(>^-^)> Rehtrop (Biggest contributions in saving data to the memory card)
(>^-^)> Bombsquad (Biggest contributions in writing the framework for the Galactic Log's custom ui)
(>^-^)> Eucalyptus (Biggest contributions in designing menu formats and displaying custom badge sprites onscreen)
All 4 of us (myself included) contributed more than just the summaries listed here
||   Modding Tools   ||
Custom stages wouldn't be possible without everyone who contributed to the development of SMB hacking,
and custom code wouldn't be possible without everyone who contributed to the development of WSMod.
Trying to credit each individual person who made hacking what it is today would be trying to credit an entire community,
so that's exactly what I'll do...

||   Playtesters   ||
(>^-^)> Eddy (Literally collected every stunt goal, banana bunch, and stage achievement, plus tons of help console lag-testing)
Special thanks to eddy for putting in SO much extra time into testing all the pack's bonuses and giving me feedback on just about everything
(>^-^)> 42guy42 (Focused on stress-testing speedy completions and lots of stunt goals)
(>^-^)> Rehtrop (Provided very thorough feedback which helped immensely in improving the stage designs)
(>^-^)> Null (Focused on difficulty balancing and readability)
(>^-^)> Walkr_
(>^-^)> Goobz
(>^-^)> Dyrude
(>^-^)> Eucalyptus (Focused on hunting down visual blemishes)
Everyone gave countless amounts of suggestions to improve literally every stage from its first draft.
Even if I didn't list a focus, your playthroughs and feedback all meant just as much to me!
Thank you also for all the moral support. Seeing your excitement after marking down each stage was infinitely heart-warming & motivational <3
