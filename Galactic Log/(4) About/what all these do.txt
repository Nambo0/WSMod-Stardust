Each sub-menu will just display a pure text box with only the
ability to back-out (multiple pages if needed) to explain each
concept:

========================================================================
Unlocking Bonus Modes:

========================================================================
Stunt Goals:
Every stage in Story Mode has a purple [PURP]Stunt Goal\ in a
particularly hard to reach spot (sometimes multiple spots). Clearing
one in Story or Practice Mode will award that stage's [PURP]Stunt Badge\[ICON].
Badges on every stage can be found in the [BLUE]Story Mode\ section of the

Interstellar: [BEFORE UNLOCK]
Unlock this bonus mode by claiming the following achievement:

[GOLD]STUNT PILOT\ | Complete 1 [PURP]stunt goal\ in each world  ~  (Unlocks All Bonus Modes)

You can check which [PURP]stunt goals\ you've completed by looking for
[PURP]Stunt Badges\[ICON] in the [BLUE]Story Mode\ section of the Galactic log.

Interstellar: [AFTER UNLOCK]
Interstellar is a bonus mode with 10 massive bonus stages played
back-to-back. You have 300 seconds (or 60 in Blitz Mode) to collect as many
[YELLOW]bananas\ as possible on all 10 stages, and at the end your total
banana count will be ranked. High score runs can be viewed in the Interstellar
section of the [BLUE]Galactic log\

[PENALTIES & BONUSES]
Falling out does NOT reset the timer or bunches collected. Instead, you
will incur a 20 second penalty each time you fall out.

Each stage has a [YELLOW]banana goal\ which will award 50 bananas upon
completion. Remember that it will bring you to the next stage, so only
go for the goal once you're satisfied with your banana count!

Debug: [AFTER UNLOCK]
Debug is a bonus mode made up of unfinished concepts, outdated prototypes,
and silly joke stages. The category is split up into 4 sub-sections:

HOT GARBAGE | Joke/troll stages that I made for fun
VERSION 0's | Old revisions of stages that got heavily changed or completely re-made
UNUSED CONCEPTS | Stage concepts that never got fully realized into fully-fledged stages
THE UNPLAYABLE ZONE | Concepts or joke stages that are either STUPIDLY hard, or straight up impossible
    * In all modes, stages can be skipped by holding DPAD DOWN for 3 seconds.

PLEASE NOTE: This mode is meant to be a silly showcase of the inner
workings of this pack's development. I'm fully aware that these stages
are bad. [GREEN]That's why they are here.\ I hope you enjoy how broken
they are \o/
========================================================================
Monuments: [BEFORE UNLOCK]

[GOLD]STUNT PILOT\ | Complete 1 [PURP]stunt goal\ in each world  ~  (Unlocks All Bonus Modes)

Monuments: [AFTER UNLOCK]
Monuments is a trophy room for some of this pack's bonus goals. The circle of smaller statues
each represents one world, and avove that world you can see which clear, stunt, and sweep
badges you have completed, along with the stage challenge achievement above those 3 rows.

If you get all 10 stunt goals or sweep badges in any world, that world's statue will be given
a special effect!

If you get all 100 stung goals or sweep badges in story, something special will appear on the
giant empty pedestals outside the circle

The center of the stage has a spinning medallion representing your best interstellar rank!
